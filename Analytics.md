## Google Analytics

The former Fabric.io products were rolled into Firebase after Google acquired Fabric.io:

    http://get.fabric.io/

Note that the linked Google Analytics page actually has a Firebase URL:

    http://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/

[Even so, the linked page describes itself as Google Analytics - and is the place to go for mobile.]

Offers an integration with Crashlytics (along with other Google services).

## upland Localytics

The former Localytics was acquired by Upland Software: http://www.localytics.com/

Tracks three types of metrics:

* Session - how an end user interacts with your app
* Events - what types of actions that user takes
* Profiles - who the user is
