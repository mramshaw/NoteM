# Roadmap

List the planned __Application__ improvements.

[These are general improvements unrelated to hardware or deployment.]

## Order

The order should be roughly as follows:

1. [Export / Import](#export--import)
2. [Search](#search)
3. [Categories](#categories)

[Items __2__ and __3__ could just as easily be __3__ and __2__.]

## Export / Import

Provide the ability to Export/Import (back up and restore) the current notes.

This should - among other things - allow for transporting notes from one device
to another, as well as the ability to edit the notes in a text editor or a
spreadsheet.

The __import__ facility should presumably reinitialize the database, although
perhaps this might simply be an option.

## Search

Provide the ability to search within the current notes.

If [categories](#categories) are implemented first, this should only be within
the current note category.

## Categories

Provide the ability to organize notes into categories.

These should operate much like folders, and be displayed first before notes.
